# Purpose

This is the primary directory for all types of source files. The sources are categorized into three main subdirectories:

ğŸ“‚ iac (Infrastructure as Code): This directory contains a structured folder hierarchy for managing Infrastructure as Code templates, such as ARM, Terraform, and Bicep\
ğŸ“‚ params (Parameters): In this folder, you'll find all parameter files needed for specific processes and configurations.\
ğŸ“‚ scripts: The "scripts" directory is organized with a folder structure designed for the effective management of PowerShell scripts.

Example:

```html
ğŸ“¦src
 â”£ ğŸ“‚iac
 â”£ ğŸ“‚params
 â”£ ğŸ“‚scripts
 â”— ğŸ“œreadme.md
 ```
