# Purpose

This is the main directory for all types of utility files. The utilities are
categorized into three main subdirectories:

ğŸ“‚ helpers: This directory is a repository for utility scripts that are
essential for the platform's development and maintenance.
ğŸ“‚ private: This directory is designated for private and personal scripts used
during the debugging and building processes.
ğŸ“‚ references: This directory serves as a storage for unused but potentially
valuable files.

Example:

```html
ğŸ“¦tools
 â”£ ğŸ“‚helpers
 â”£ ğŸ“‚private
 â”£ ğŸ“‚references
 â”— ğŸ“œreadme.md
 ```
