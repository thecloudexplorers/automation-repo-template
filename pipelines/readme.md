# Pipelines structure

All pipelines must be placed within this folder. For each individual pipeline,
create a corresponding subfolder. Please adhere to the following structural
rules:

- Each pipeline should have its own dedicated folder.
- Depending on the design of the pipeline, you can choose between two options:
  - A single `ğŸ“œ.yml` file that contains all the required stages.
  - Multiple `ğŸ“œ.yml` files to represent different stages of the pipeline.
- In addition, each pipeline folder must include a `ğŸ“œreadme.md` file that
  contains technical documentation elucidating the specifics of the respective
  pipeline.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain an organized and well-documented
approach to managing pipelines.

Example:

```html
ğŸ“¦ pipelines
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ management
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“„ managementStructure.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“„ readme.md
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ workload
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“„ deploy-workload.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“„ readme.md
 â”£ ğŸ“‚ microservice-deploy
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“„ deploy-microservice.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“„ readme.md
 â”— ğŸ“„ readme.md

```
